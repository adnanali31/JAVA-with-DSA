// To create a Java file, follow these steps:

// Open a text editor such as Notepad, Sublime Text, or Eclipse.
// Create a new file and save it with a ".java" extension. For example, "MyJavaProgram.java".
// In the text editor, type the Java code for your program. For example, the following code prints "Hello, World!" to the console:

public class MyJavaProgram {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
  }
}

// Save the Java file.
// That's it! You have now created a Java file. Note that in order to run the Java program, you will need to compile it first. You can use a Java compiler such as the javac command-line tool to compile your Java code into bytecode, which can then be executed using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
